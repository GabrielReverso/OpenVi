[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
     [1mex [22mis a line-oriented text editor; [1mvi [22mis a screen-oriented text editor.
     [1mex [22mand [1mvi [22mare different interfaces to the same program, and it is possi‚Äê
     ble to switch back and forth during an edit session.  [1mview [22mis the equiva‚Äê
     lent of using the [1m-R [22m(read-only) option of [1mvi[22m.

     This manual page is the one provided with the [1mnex[22m/[1mnvi [22mversions of the
     [1mex[22m/[1mvi [22mtext editors.  [1mnex[22m/[1mnvi [22mare intended as bug-for-bug compatible re‚Äê
     placements for the original Fourth Berkeley Software Distribution (4BSD)
     [1mex [22mand [1mvi [22mprograms.  For the rest of this manual page, [1mnex[22m/[1mnvi [22mis used
     only when it's necessary to distinguish it from the historic implementa‚Äê
     tions of [1mex[22m/[1mvi[22m.

     This manual page is intended for users already familiar with [1mex[22m/[1mvi[22m.  Any‚Äê
     one else should almost certainly read a good tutorial on the editor be‚Äê
     fore this manual page.  If you're in an unfamiliar environment, and you
     absolutely have to get work done immediately, read the section after the
     options description, entitled [4mFAST[24m [4mSTARTUP[24m.  It's probably enough to get
     you going.

     The following options are available:

     [1m-c [4m[22mcmd[24m    Execute [4mcmd[24m on the first file loaded.  Particularly useful for
               initial positioning in the file, although [4mcmd[24m is not limited to
               positioning commands.  This is the POSIX 1003.2 interface for
               the historic ‚Äú+cmd‚Äù syntax.  [1mnex[22m/[1mnvi [22msupports both the old and
               new syntax.

     [1m-e        [22mStart editing in ex mode, as if the command name were [1mex[22m.

     [1m-F        [22mDon't copy the entire file when first starting to edit.  (The
               default is to make a copy in case someone else modifies the
               file during your edit session.)

     [1m-R        [22mStart editing in read-only mode, as if the command name was
               [1mview[22m, or the [1mreadonly [22moption was set.

     [1m-r        [22mRecover the specified files or, if no files are specified, list
               the files that could be recovered.  If no recoverable files by
               the specified name exist, the file is edited as if the [1m-r [22mop‚Äê
               tion had not been specified.

     [1m-S        [22mRun with the [1msecure [22medit option set, disallowing all access to
               external programs.

     [1m-s        [22mEnter batch mode; applicable only to [1mex [22medit sessions.  Batch
               mode is useful when running [1mex [22mscripts.  Prompts, informative
               messages and other user oriented messages are turned off, and
               no startup files or environment variables are read.  This is
               the POSIX 1003.2 interface for the historic ‚Äú-‚Äù argument.
               [1mnex[22m/[1mnvi [22msupports both the old and new syntax.

     [1m-t [4m[22mtag[24m    Start editing at the specified [4mtag[24m (see ctags(1)).

     [1m-v        [22mStart editing in vi mode, as if the command name was [1mvi[22m.

     [1m-w [4m[22msize[24m   Set the initial window size to the specified number of lines.

     Command input for [1mex[22m/[1mvi [22mis read from the standard input.  In the [1mvi [22min‚Äê
     terface, it is an error if standard input is not a terminal.  In the [1mex[0m
     interface, if standard input is not a terminal, [1mex [22mwill read commands
     from it regardless; however, the session will be a batch mode session,
     exactly as if the [1m-s [22moption had been specified.

[1mFAST STARTUP[0m
     This section will tell you the minimum amount that you need to do simple
     editing tasks using [1mvi[22m.  If you've never used any screen editor before,
     you're likely to have problems even with this simple introduction.  In
     that case you should find someone that already knows [1mvi [22mand have them
     walk you through this section.

     [1mvi [22mis a screen editor.  This means that it takes up almost the entire
     screen, displaying part of the file on each screen line, except for the
     last line of the screen.  The last line of the screen is used for you to
     give commands to [1mvi[22m, and for [1mvi [22mto give information to you.

     The other fact that you need to understand is that [1mvi [22mis a modeful edi‚Äê
     tor, i.e. you are either entering text or you are executing commands, and
     you have to be in the right mode to do one or the other.  You will be in
     command mode when you first start editing a file.  There are commands
     that switch you into input mode.  There is only one key that takes you
     out of input mode, and that is the ‚ü®escape‚ü© key.

     Key names are written using angle brackets, e.g. ‚ü®escape‚ü© means the
     ‚Äúescape‚Äù key, usually labeled ‚ÄúEsc‚Äù on your terminal's keyboard.  If
     you're ever confused as to which mode you're in, keep entering the
     ‚ü®escape‚ü© key until [1mvi [22mbeeps at you.  Generally, [1mvi [22mwill beep at you if
     you try and do something that's not allowed.  It will also display error
     messages.

     To start editing a file, enter the following command:

           $ vi file

     The command you should enter as soon as you start editing is:

           :set verbose showmode

     This will make the editor give you verbose error messages and display the
     current mode at the bottom of the screen.

     The commands to move around the file are:

     [1mh       [22mMove the cursor left one character.

     [1mj       [22mMove the cursor down one line.

     [1mk       [22mMove the cursor up one line.

     [1ml       [22mMove the cursor right one character.

     ‚ü®[1mcursor-arrows[22m‚ü©
             The cursor arrow keys should work, too.

     [1m/[22mtext   Search for the string ‚Äútext‚Äù in the file, and move the cursor to
             its first character.

     The commands to enter new text are:

     [1ma         [22mAppend new text, after the cursor.

     [1mi         [22mInsert new text, before the cursor.

     [1mO         [22mOpen a new line above the line the cursor is on, and start en‚Äê
               tering text.

     [1mo         [22mOpen a new line below the line the cursor is on, and start en‚Äê
               tering text.

     ‚ü®[1mescape[22m‚ü©  Once you've entered input mode using one of the [1ma[22m, [1mi[22m, [1mO [22mor [1mo[0m
               commands, use ‚ü®[1mescape[22m‚ü© to quit entering text and return to com‚Äê
               mand mode.

     The commands to copy text are:

     [1mp       [22mAppend the copied line after the line the cursor is on.

     [1myy      [22mCopy the line the cursor is on.

     The commands to delete text are:

     [1mdd      [22mDelete the line the cursor is on.

     [1mx       [22mDelete the character the cursor is on.

     The commands to write the file are:

     [1m:w      [22mWrite the file back to the file with the name that you originally
             used as an argument on the [1mvi [22mcommand line.

     [1m:w [4m[22mfile_name[0m
             Write the file back to the file with the name [4mfile_name[24m.

     The commands to quit editing and exit the editor are:

     [1m:q      [22mQuit editing and leave [1mvi [22m(if you've modified the file, but not
             saved your changes, [1mvi [22mwill refuse to quit).

     [1m:q!     [22mQuit, discarding any modifications that you may have made.

     One final caution: Unusual characters can take up more than one column on
     the screen, and long lines can take up more than a single screen line.
     The above commands work on ‚Äúphysical‚Äù characters and lines, i.e. they af‚Äê
     fect the entire line no matter how many screen lines it takes up and the
     entire character no matter how many screen columns it takes up.

[1mREGULAR EXPRESSIONS[0m
     [1mex[22m/[1mvi [22msupports regular expressions (REs), as documented in re_format(7),
     for line addresses, as the first part of the [1mex substitute[22m, [1mglobal [22mand [1mv[0m
     commands, and in search patterns.  Basic regular expressions (BREs) are
     enabled by default; extended regular expressions (EREs) are used if the
     [1mextended [22moption is enabled.  The use of regular expressions can be
     largely disabled using the [1mmagic [22moption.

     The following strings have special meanings in the [1mex[22m/[1mvi [22mversion of regu‚Äê
     lar expressions:

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22mAn empty regular expression is equivalent to the last regular expres‚Äê
         sion used.

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22m‚Äò\<‚Äô matches the beginning of the word.

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22m‚Äò\>‚Äô matches the end of the word.

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22m‚Äò~‚Äô matches the replacement part of the last [1ms [22mcommand.

[1mBUFFERS[0m
     A buffer is an area where commands can save changed or deleted text for
     later use.  [1mvi [22mbuffers are named with a single character preceded by a
     double quote, for example "‚ü®c‚ü©; [1mex [22mbuffers are the same, but without the
     double quote.  [1mnex[22m/[1mnvi [22mpermits the use of any character without another
     meaning in the position where a buffer name is expected.

     All buffers are either in [4mline[24m [4mmode[24m or [4mcharacter[24m [4mmode[24m.  Inserting a buf‚Äê
     fer in line mode into the text creates new lines for each of the lines it
     contains, while a buffer in character mode creates new lines for any
     lines [4mother[24m than the first and last lines it contains.  The first and
     last lines are inserted at the current cursor position, becoming part of
     the current line.  If there is more than one line in the buffer, the cur‚Äê
     rent line itself will be split.  All [1mex [22mcommands which store text into
     buffers do so in line mode.  The behaviour of [1mvi [22mcommands depend on their
     associated motion command:

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22m‚ü®[1mcontrol-A[22m‚ü©, [1mh[22m, [1ml[22m, [1m,[22m, [1m0[22m, [1mB[22m, [1mE[22m, [1mF[22m, [1mT[22m, [1mW[22m, [1m^[22m, [1mb[22m, [1me[22m, [1mf [22mand [1mt [22mmake the
         destination buffer character-oriented.

     [1m‚Ä¢   j[22m, ‚ü®[1mcontrol-M[22m‚ü©, [1mk[22m, [1m'[22m, [1m-[22m, [1mG[22m, [1mH[22m, [1mL[22m, [1mM[22m, [1m_ [22mand [1m| [22mmake the destination
         buffer line-oriented.

     [1m‚Ä¢   $[22m, [1m%[22m, [1m`[22m, [1m([22m, [1m)[22m, [1m/[22m, [1m?[22m, [1m[[[22m, [1m]][22m, [1m{ [22mand [1m} [22mmake the destination buffer
         character-oriented, unless the starting and end positions are the
         first and last characters on a line.  In that case, the buffer is
         line-oriented.

     The [1mex [22mcommand [1mdisplay buffers [22mdisplays the current mode for each buffer.

     Buffers named ‚Äòa‚Äô through ‚Äòz‚Äô may be referred to using their uppercase
     equivalent, in which case new content will be appended to the buffer, in‚Äê
     stead of replacing it.

     Buffers named ‚Äò1‚Äô through ‚Äò9‚Äô are special.  A region of text modified us‚Äê
     ing the [1mc [22m(change) or [1md [22m(delete) commands is placed into the numeric buf‚Äê
     fer ‚Äò1‚Äô if no other buffer is specified and if it meets one of the fol‚Äê
     lowing conditions:

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22mIt includes characters from more than one line.

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22mIt is specified using a line-oriented motion.

     [1m‚Ä¢   [22mIt is specified using one of the following motion commands:
         ‚ü®[1mcontrol-A[22m‚ü©, [1m`[22m‚ü®[1mcharacter[22m‚ü©, [1mn[22m, [1mN[22m, [1m%[22m, [1m/[22m, [1m{[22m, [1m}[22m, [1m([22m, [1m)[22m, and [1m?[22m.

     Before this copy is done, the previous contents of buffer ‚Äò1‚Äô are moved
     into buffer ‚Äò2‚Äô, ‚Äò2‚Äô into buffer ‚Äò3‚Äô, and so on.  The contents of buffer
     ‚Äò9‚Äô are discarded.  Note that this rotation occurs [4mregardless[24m of the user
     specifying another buffer.  In [1mvi[22m, text may be explicitly stored into the
     numeric buffers.  In this case, the buffer rotation occurs before the re‚Äê
     placement of the buffer's contents.  The numeric buffers are only avail‚Äê
     able in [1mvi [22mmode.

[1mVI COMMANDS[0m
     The following section describes the commands available in the command
     mode of the [1mvi [22meditor.  The following words have a special meaning in the
     commands description:

     [4mbigword[24m  A set of non-whitespace characters.
     [4mbuffer[24m   Temporary area where commands may place text.  If not specified,
              the default buffer is used.  See also [4mBUFFERS[24m, above.
     [4mcount[24m    A positive number used to specify the desired number of itera‚Äê
              tions of a command.  It defaults to 1 if not specified.
     [4mmotion[24m   A cursor movement command which indicates the other end of the
              affected region of text, the first being the current cursor po‚Äê
              sition.  Repeating the command character makes it affect the
              whole current line.
     [4mword[24m     A sequence of letters, digits or underscores.

     [4mbuffer[24m and [4mcount[24m, if both present, may be specified in any order.  [4mmotion[0m
     and [4mcount[24m, if both present, are effectively multiplied together and con‚Äê
